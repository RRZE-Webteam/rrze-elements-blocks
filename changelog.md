## [1.0.14] - 2024-12-19

Improved transformation behavior from and to blocks to ease the working process inside the editor.
Fixed an issue, where users with different language settings might get a Block Deprecation inside the editor.

### Added

### Fixed
- [#86 Expand-All-Link Deprecation](https://github.com/RRZE-Webteam/rrze-elements-blocks/issues/176)


## [1.0.13] - 2024-12-13

A new store for managing the jumpNames throughout the Element Block suite minimizes duplicate id's and errors.

### Fixed
- [#174 The Jumpname issue](https://github.com/RRZE-Webteam/rrze-elements-blocks/issues/174)
- JumpNames are automatically generated based on the input title. Per default, generation is switched off. If a jumpName starts with the autogenerated tag panel_, the flag is positive and jumpNames are generated automatically via the title-Attribute. This also makes sure, that already set jumpnames are not affected by the change.
- The fix should also fix an issue where moving Accordion tabs from one into another accordion was not possible due to a duplication of JumpNames.
